  <p><tt>Rihanna Song <i>Bitch Better Have My Money!</i> <b>blamed for <em>Crime?</em>:</b></tt></p>
  <p>Employee at a local Bar and Restaurant did not receive her monthly salary last Tuesday. Witnesses say they saw the female employee ask for her money and the manager refused to pay. The manager, also a female, was often referred to, by both customers and colleagues, as <i>a real Biatch!</i> A short time after the employee returned blasting the Rihanna song <u>Bitch Better Have My Money</u> and <b>drop-kicked</b> the manager in the head. The manager has been reported to be alright and somehow found the employee's money. No charges have been filed since the police also came to the conclusion that the bitch should've had her money.</p>
